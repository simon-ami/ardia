# Native manual tab unloading and discard recovery

- Status: native command manually validated; Auto Tab Discard remains unresolved.
- Source: [fork PR #6](https://github.com/simon-ami/ardia/pull/6) and
  [upstream issue #634](https://github.com/mantrakp04/ardia/issues/634).
- Behavior: provide Unload Tab, Unload N Tabs, and configurable Unload Tab(s) in keyboard shortcuts/app menu,
  with no default binding. Use native WebView discard; retain tab identity, rows, and navigation history.
  Report native refusals.
- Before unloading, select an awake same-window, same-space MRU page, excluding all targets. Open a new tab
  if none exists; never remove targets or close the window. See [successor selection](cross-section-close-mru.md).
- Apply recovery to extension discards only when their native event reaches the app. Background discards
  do not change selection; ignore replacements in a different shared-data space.
- Code: `apps/browser/src/state/tabs/discardActions.ts`, `components/window/TabWebView.tsx`, command catalog,
  tab menus, and generated native command tables.
- Checks: `state/tabs/discardActions.test.mjs` and close/menu cases under `apps/browser/src`.
- Manual: unload one/multiple tabs; check replacement, retained rows, wake, Back history, and a bound shortcut.
- Open: #634 is not proven fixed for the real extension path. Simon accepts the native command and has
  deferred further extension debugging; do not reopen it without new evidence or a request.
