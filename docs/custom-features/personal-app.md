# Personal app isolation and local signing

- Status: active; migrated-profile behavior manually validated. Lifecycle failure paths use disposable-profile tests.
- Source: [fork PR #5](https://github.com/simon-ami/ardia/pull/5),
  [PR #6](https://github.com/simon-ami/ardia/pull/6).
- Behavior: deliver a standalone Release at `~/Applications/Ardia Personal.app`, bundle ID
  `dev.simon.ardia.personal`, with separate profile/configuration and `ardia-personal` runtime/credential service.
  Keep the official app and CLI unchanged. Disable the upstream updater/CLI installer.
- Reuse Simon's signing identity. Permit shared `Ardia Safe Storage` only after validating the personal
  signature and sealed files. Keep mock storage for scratch/ad hoc builds and real-profile debugging restrictions.
- Register HTTP/HTTPS without changing the chosen default. Reject stale builds; activate paired app/CLI versions.
  Snapshot the stopped personal profile/preferences first. Failed backup blocks installation; failed activation
  restores the previous app/CLI. Share userscript sources, not installed copies or live Chromium folders.
- Code/checks: `scripts/personal/` (path/lifecycle/signing tests), `ArdiaPersonalSigning.h`, `ArdiaLaunchConfig.mm`,
  `ArdiaHost+Launch.mm`, `CliInstaller.swift`, and CLI `browse/vault.py`.
- Manual when affected: existing login survives restart; profiles/settings, Bitwarden, scripts, and CLI routing work.
- Details only when needed: [setup, snapshots, and recovery](../personal-app.md).
