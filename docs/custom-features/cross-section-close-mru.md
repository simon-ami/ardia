# MRU successor across pinned and regular tabs

- Status: active; manually validated.
- Source: [fork PR #6](https://github.com/simon-ami/ardia/pull/6).
- Behavior: closing or unloading the active tab selects the most recent awake, non-empty page in the same
  window and space, across regular tabs, pins, pinned groups, and Top Apps. Exclude every affected tab.
  MRU takes precedence over opener/sibling preference when an awake candidate exists.
- Preserve pinned-tab unloading versus regular-tab removal, existing no-candidate/window-close fallbacks,
  and selection when closing a background tab. Record activation of the selected successor.
- Code: `apps/browser/src/state/tabs/{awakeMru.ts,tabs.ts}`.
- Checks: `closing.test.mjs`, `tabs.test.mjs`, and `discardActions.test.mjs` in that folder.
  Recency tests need distinct activation timestamps.
- Manual: alternate visits between a regular tab and a pin/Top App, then close the newest tab in both
  directions. The newest awake same-space page wins; sleeping pages do not.
